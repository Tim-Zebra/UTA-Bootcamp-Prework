    <h2>BIO</h2>

    <p>
        "A band for the fans," is one way to define progresive metal band Born of Osiris (BOS).
        Between heavy rifts, plenty of chugging, and vicious vocals this band has lived up to the definition of fan service.
        Contrary to many screamo bands out there, BOS maintains a melody to their music and stays away from a sound that can only be described as "loud."
    </p>

    <p>
        The band has retained their line up since their early days back in 2009, with their one exception being a change in their bass guitarist in 2018.
        As a result the band has stayed true to themselves, while introducing new styles and sounds giving each album something different to standout.
